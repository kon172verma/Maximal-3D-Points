# Maximal-3D-Points
A point p is said to dominated by point q if p.x ≤ q.x , p.y ≤ q.y , p.z ≤ q.z . Given a set of points P = {p1, p2,...,pn} in 3-dimensoinal space, each represented by its x, y, z integer coordinates, a point is said to be maximal iff it is not dominated by any other point. Here, we are finding all such points.
